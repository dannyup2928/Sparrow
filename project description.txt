Approximately 2 million people experience severe injuries from car accidents each year in the United States. We hope to drastically reduce that number with Sparrow, a product designed to automatically scan license plates and alert users to reckless drivers.

Sparrow is a smart dashcam system that is intended to increase the safety of those who use it. The system is composed of a few main components, a dash camera, an ALPR board, a smartphone app, and a backend database. 

The ALPR board takes video input from the dash camera to read and interpret license plate data of the cars around the user in real-time. Then the board uploads the recorded video and JSON file of the detected plates to the database. The mobile application is then used to browse the database video files by the license plate identifiers.

In a final product, these systems will be used in tandem to alert drivers when a hazardous driver is near them. If the plate of a driver that has been properly flagged as dangerous is detected by the user’s system, then both an audio and visual alert will prompt the user on their smartphone. 

The system aims to make a strong impact beyond just the safety of its immediate users. Through careful restricted access protocols, law enforcement could use the system to find stolen vehicles, fugitives and even amber alert vehicles with locational data. As a police officer that we interviewed eloquently put it, this system will “be a ring doorbell for the road”.
